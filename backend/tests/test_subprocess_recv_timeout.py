"""Every sidecar's generate deadline outlasts the job budget it was granted (#2103).

#1611 raised IndexTTS's deadline because a healthy synthesis was being killed at
60s. That fixed the reported engine and left the class default alone, so four
more engines — confucius4, dots_tts, moss_tts_v15, supertonic3 — inherited the
same 60s and were killed the same way.

60s is the ``health_check`` ping budget. Inheriting it as a *generation*
deadline puts the sidecar watchdog five to ten times below
``model_manager.generate_timeout_s`` (300s accelerated, 600s CPU), so the
watchdog reclaims a sidecar the caller still considers well inside its budget.
Every engine that overrode the hook picked 300s..900s, i.e. at or above the
accelerated budget; the four that stayed silent are the whole bug.

The invariant below is what keeps a new engine from re-entering that state by
omission, which is the part #1611 could not do by fixing one engine.
